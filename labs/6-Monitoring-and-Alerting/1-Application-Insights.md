# Using Application Insights to View Telemetry Data

# What is Application Insights?

Application Insights, a feature of Azure Monitor, is an extensible Application Performance Management (APM) service tailored for developers and DevOps professionals. It helps monitor live applications, automatically detects performance anomalies, and includes robust analytics tools to diagnose issues and understand user interactions. Application Insights is designed to continuously enhance your application's performance and usability.

# Open Application Insights

To begin, select the Application Insights resource you created earlier and ensure you have the ingress IP ready. Let's explore various ways to view and analyze Application Insights data.

# Live Metrics
When deploying a new build, monitor near-real-time performance indicators to ensure everything operates as expected.
