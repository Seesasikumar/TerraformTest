# Azure DevOps setup

## Azure DevOps Organisation Setup
The first setup to setting up Azure DevOps is to create an organisation

1. [Sign into Azure DevOps](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=307137)
2. Select **New Organisation**
3. Enter your preferred Azure DevOps organisation name and hosting location. (For this lab, the organisation name is thomasthorntoncloud.)
4. Once your organisation is created, you can access it anytime using:
`https://dev.azure.com/{yourorganisation}`

Once an organisation has been setup, next is to create an Azure DevOps project

## Azure DevOps Project Creation
Creating a project allows you to utilise repositories, pipelines, and other features within Azure DevOps.

1. [Sign into Azure DevOps](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=307137)
2. Select organisation that you have created above
3. Select **New Project**
4. Enter new project name & description

## Azure Workload Identity Federation
Using a Workload Identity Federation is considered best practice for DevOps within your CI/CD pipeline. It serves as an identity to authenticate within your Azure Subscription, allowing you to deploy the relevant Terraform code.

1. To begin creation, within your newly created Azure DevOps Project â€“ select **Project Settings**
2. Select **Service Connections**
3. Select **Create Service Connection** -> **Azure Resource Manager** -> **Workload Identity federation (Automatic)**
4. Enter subscription/resource group to where service connection will be created. Create with relevant service connection name

6. Within **Manage Workload Identity** options, update the branding and name to give a relevant identity name (it initially has a random string at the end).

7. Assign the necessary Service Principal role to the subscription. For this lab, the Workload Identity will be given **User Access Admin**(required to add rbac control during AKS deploy stage) access to the subscription.
