# CI/CD

Learn how to set up and configure a pipeline that incorporates CI/CD practices:

![](images/cicdimage.png)

1. Developer changes application source code.
2. Application is committed to the source code repository in Azure Repos.
3. Continuous integration triggers an application build.
4. Continuous deployment within Azure Pipelines triggers an automated deployment with environment-specific configuration values.
5. Updated application is deployed to an environment-specific Kubernetes cluster.
6. Application Insights collects and analyzes health, performance, and usage data.
7. Azure Monitor collects and analyzes health, performance, and usage data.
